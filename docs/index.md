This add-on will retrieve your activities and second-by-second heart rate, cadence, power and more from Strava for easy analysis in Splunk. It allows you to not only view your own data, but you can add your friends or co-workers as well for some healthy competition.

You can get the app on <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4755/" target="_blank">Splunkbase</a>.
